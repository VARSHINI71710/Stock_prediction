📊 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM & Gradio

Live Demo: Stock Prediction Gradio App

📌 Overview

This project predicts the next-day closing price of a stock using a LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It uses multiple features including open, high, low, close, volume and technical indicators such as moving averages. The prediction is presented via an interactive Gradio web app.

✨ Features

📈 Predict next-day closing price of any stock.

🧠 Uses multi-feature LSTM with 60-day sequences.

📊 Includes technical indicators: MA5, MA10, MA20.

⏹️ Early stopping implemented during training to prevent overfitting.

🖥️ Interactive Gradio app to upload CSV files and get predictions.

💰 Outputs predicted closing price based on latest stock data.

🗂 Dataset

Dataset used: all_stocks_5yr.csv

Required columns:

date

Name (Stock symbol)

open

high

low

close

volume

Example source: Yahoo Finance historical data or Kaggle’s “S&P 500 5-Year Stock Data”.

⚙ How It Works
🧹 Data Preprocessing

Sorts data by date.

Selects the stock with the most occurrences (mode of Name).

Adds technical indicators: MA5, MA10, MA20.

Scales all features using MinMaxScaler.

🔄 Sequence Generation

Uses the last 60 days of data to predict the next day's closing price.

🧱 Model

LSTM layer with 100 units.

Dense layer outputting a single price value.

Compiled with Adam optimizer, MSE loss, and MAE metric.

🏋️ Training

80/20 Train/Test split.

EarlyStopping on validation loss (patience=5).

📊 Prediction

Gradio interface lets users upload a CSV.

Outputs predicted next closing price.

🚀 How to Run
python app.py


Open the URL shown in the terminal (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7860).

Upload a CSV file containing stock data (open, high, low, close, volume).

View the predicted next closing price.

Browser output example:

📈 Predicted Next Close Price: 172.45


Shows the next day’s predicted closing price for the selected stock.

Optional: Future updates can display a graph of last 60 days + predicted price.

📏 Metrics

✅ Train/Test Accuracy (±1%)

🔼🔽 Train/Test Direction Accuracy (UP/DOWN)

📉 MAE & MSE used for model evaluation

🌟 Future Improvements

📊 Add visualization of actual vs predicted prices in Gradio.

🏢 Support prediction for multiple stocks at once.

🌐 Deploy as a web app on Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Cloud.
